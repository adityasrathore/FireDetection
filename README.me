### Fire Detection
The fire detection model is a Python-based solution that uses deep learning, image processing, and machine learning techniques to accurately classify images into two categories: fire and non-fire. This model is built using popular libraries such as Keras, OpenCV (cv2), and scikit-learn, making it a powerful tool for fire detection in images.

Feature Extraction: OpenCV (cv2) is used to extract relevant features from the images, such as color, texture, and shape features, which serve as input to the model.
Model Building: The model is built using Keras, a popular deep learning library, with multiple layers including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers for feature extraction and classification.
Model Training: The model is trained using the preprocessed images and their corresponding labels,
